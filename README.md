## Installation

**Method 1** (recommended)

1. Head to https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve
2. Click on "Download"
3. Select the free Linux version
4. Unzip `DaVinci_Resolve_XX.Y.Z_Linux.zip` archive
5. Double click `DaVinci_Resolve_XX.Y.Z_Linux.run` and follow installation guide

   - or run `./DaVinci_Resolve_XX.Y.Z_Linux.run`

   ![DaVinci Resolve Installer](./images/davinci-resolve-installer.png)

6. Start Resolve by searching for it in your applications

   - or run `/opt/resolve/bin/resolve`

**Method 2**

1. Head to https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve
2. Click on "Download"
3. Select the free Linux version
4. Unzip `DaVinci_Resolve_XX.Y.Z_Linux.zip` archive
5. Head to https://www.danieltufvesson.com/makeresolvedeb
6. Download script with same version as your downloaded Resolve
7. Unzip `makeresolvedeb_XX.Y.Z-X.sh.tar.gz`

- Your folder should now include the following files:
  ```
  DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_XX.Y.Z_Linux.run
  Linux_Installation_Instructions.pdf
  makeresolvedeb_XX.Y.Z-X.sh
  ```

8. Run the `makeresolvedeb` script while passing the filename of DaVinci Resolve's .run file.

  ```
  ./makeresolvedeb_XX.Y.Z-X.sh DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_XX.Y.Z_Linux.run
  ```
- Optionally you can avoid installing the Blackmagic RAW Player / Speed Test apps by adding the `--skip-braw`.  


9. Install the Resolve via the created `.deb` file

- Double click and click "Install"
- Or run in terminal:

  ```
  sudo dpkg -i davinci-resolve_XX.Y.Z-X_amd64.deb
  ```

10. If you get an error saying "Sorry. Need 'xyz' to continue", just install it

- For example if the error is: "Sorry. Need 'xorriso' to continue", you should run:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install xorriso
  ```

## Media Import

Unfortunately DaVinci Resolve's free version doesn't support `.mp4` import on Linux. Both version also neither supports the `AAC` audio codec. But we can work around this issue:

**Convert your footage to a supported format**

There is a really powerful tool called [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for converting video file formats. You can install it by running `sudo apt install ffmpeg`.

Then you can convert almost any video format to something, that can be imported into DaVinci Resolve by running:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 3 -qscale:v 9 -acodec pcm_s16le output.mov
```

| Flag                | Explanation                                                                         |
| ------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i <input>`        | input video file (e.g. `-i my-movie.mp4`)                                           |
| `-c:v prores_ks`    | video codec to be ProRes Kostya                                                     |
| `-profile:v 3`      | profile (value ranges from 0 to 3, where a higher number results in better quality) |
| `-qscale:v 9`       | quality scale (value can be 5, 9 or 13, where 5 is best and 13 worst quality)       |
| `-acodec pcm_s16le` | audio codec to be pcm_s16le                                                         |
| `<output.mov>`   | output video file (e.g. `my-movie-converted.mov`)                                |

**Batch converting videos**

```
for i in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 3 -qscale:v 9 -acodec pcm_s16le "${i%.*}.mov"; done
```

**Converting audio**

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav
```

**Batch Converting audio**

```
for i in *.mp3; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -c:a pcm_s16le "${i%.*}.mp3"; done
```

**Record your footage as a supported format with [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/)**

1. Go to "Settings" ðŸ ª "Output" ðŸ ª "Recording"
2. Change "Type" to "Custom Output (FFmpeg)"
3. Set "Container Format" to "mov"
4. Set "Video Encoder" to "mpeg4"
5. Set "Audio Encoder" to "pcm_s16le"

![Open Broadcaster Software Output Settings](./images/obs-output-settings.png)

The resulting `.mov` can now be imported into DaVinci Resolve without any issues.

## Media Export

When exporting your edited video, I'd recommend:

1. Head to your "Render Settings"
2. Under Video, choose "QuickTime" as "Format"
3. Under Video, choose "MPEG" as "Format"
4. Under Audio, enable "Export Audio" if you want sound

![DaVinci Resolve Render Settings](./images/render-settings.png)

With the above settings, you don't need to compress or convert the final file again.

## Installing Sound Libraries

If you want to install the free sound library from Davinci resolve, follow these steps

Head over to the fairlight section of Davinci resolve > Sound Library and click "Download"

![Sound library download](./images/SoundLibrary.png)

You'll be sent to the Sound Library Download page for linux, put in all your info and download it.

Once downloaded, go to where the file is located

1. Left click on the file
2. Click on properties
3. Go on the Permissions tab
4. Check on "Allow executing file as program"
5. Double click on the file and choose "run in terminal"
6. If done correctly you will see the sound library download open
7. Go through all the steps and install!

![Fairlight program](./images/Fairlight_sound_program.png)

If you want to see all your sounds on the Sound Library, go to Davinci resolve and type "***"

## Uninstall Resolve

**Method 1** (recommended)

Run the same script, you used for installing Resolve (`DaVinci_Resolve_XX.Y.Z_Linux.run`) and choose "Uninstall DaVinci Resolve" in the second step.

![Uninstall DaVinci Resolve](./images/uninstall-davinci-resolve.png)

**Method 2**

```
sudo rm -f -r /opt/resolve
sudo rm -f -r ~/Documents/BlackmagicDesign
```

## Handle Common Issues

If the installation doesn't work, you probably need to research any errors from the log output.

If DaVinci Resolve doesn't start after installing you might try the following:

- Boot resolve by running `/opt/resolve/bin/resolve` and check the log output for errors
- Open `~/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/logs/` and search for errors in the log files
- Make sure you have CUDA and OpenCL libraries installed
- If you're getting an error saying, that you need `ibOpenCL.so` then just run `sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev`

If nothing fixed your issue, you can always get fast help on the [Blackmagic Forum](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/)

## Install NVIDIA driver

Determine recommended driver by running

```
ubuntu-drivers devices | grep recommended
```

The output will look like this:

```
driver : nvidia-driver-440 - third-party free recommended
```

Install recommended driver by running:

```
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-440
```

You can also install it in the user interface by opening "Additional Drivers":

![Install NVIDIA Driver](./images/nvidia-drivers.png)

Then reboot your computer.
